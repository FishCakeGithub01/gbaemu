<h1>About</h1>
<p>This is a website, where I have put some ROMs, alongside a few emulators to play the games. As of right now, I have GBA and GB games and emulators. All ROMs have been sourced from the <a href="https://archive.org">Internet Archive</a>. I use <a href="https://github.com/taisel/IodineGBA">IodineGBA</a> for the emulators.

<h1>A HUGE NOTE</h1>
<p>Before you can play <b>ANY</b> of these games, you need to follow these steps! First, install the <a href="install files/gba_bios.bin" download>GBA Bios</a> To be able to run the games. Got it installed? Great! The next step, is to download a game from my catalog! All are availible on the homepage, divided by their console. Next, once you click "emulator" on the main homepage, you should see a button on the top left that says "File." CLick it, then where it says "BIOS" click "choose file" and select the BIOS file you just installed on your drive(usually in your downloads folder.) Then, select the ROM you just installed (it usually ends in either .gba or .gb). Press play, then the game will start!</p>
<h1>EXTRA NOTES</h1>
<p>There is no auto saving! Please make sure to use the save option supplied by the game to save!<br>
The game will often run slowly, please be patient!<br>
The audio often is not functional! I would personally reccomend turning the sound off!
